                    <p>Semantic search, aided by artificial intelligence, sometimes called vector search, uses
                        specialized Large
                        Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of the query.
                        For
                        every record (element, text fragment - depending on the type of data we are dealing with:
                        database,
                        knowledge base, text corpus), a vector representation (a set of usually several hundred or more
                        numbers)
                        is calculated using a special version of an LLM optimized for this purpose (see popular
                        open-source
                        embedding models on <a href="https://ollama.com/search?c=embedding" target="_blank"

                        and the
                        description of embeddings in the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings"

                        documentation). Such a set of numbers characterizes the given content in
                        terms of meaning - text fragments talking about mines in Silesia and places of metal ore
                        extraction in
                        the Czech Republic will have values closer to each other than to a text fragment talking about
                        potato
                        salad. <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900 bg-amber-50 px-1 rounded">Semantic search uses
                            the meaning of texts, not the exact spelling of words.</strong></p>

                    <p>In the test semantic search mechanism, the <strong
                            class="font-semibold text-gray-900 bg-amber-50 px-1 rounded">Meilisearch</strong> search
                        engine was used, which
                        supports traditional full-text search, semantic search, and a hybrid of both solutions. The
                        multilingual
                        <strong>OpenAI model: text-embedding-3-small</strong> was used as the embedding model.
                    </p>

                    <p>The method of preparing WikiHum data for the search engine is similar to what was done in the <a

                    <p>Especially in the case of people, this data is currently not very extensive; the main
                        significance is
                        usually a one-sentence description. In the case of localities, a few more properties regarding
                        type and
                        ownership may influence semantic search. As WikiHum resources grow, data subject to semantic
                        search will
                        of course be supplemented.</p>

                    <p>The exported data, in a form processed into JSON structures, is imported into the <a
                            href="https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch" target="_blank"
                            class="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-800 underline decoration-amber-200 decoration-2 underline-offset-2">Meilisearch</a>
                        engine, where the
                        calculation of the text's vector representation also takes place. WikiHum data in TXT format
                        occupies
                        about 130 MB, while after import it is about 3 GB.</p>

                    <p>To make semantic search available to users, a simple application (Python + Flask) was prepared
                        with the
                        ability to request a search and view the list of results. The search is actually hybrid
                        (semantic and
                        full-text simultaneously), except that the semantic component accounts for 90% of the result
                        (the
                        semanticRatio parameter of the search engine is set to 0.9).</p>

                    <p>Example two-word query: <strong>człowiek militaria</strong> (human militaria), returns a list of
                        people
                        somehow related to the military, wars, the army, etc. While the word <strong>człowiek</strong>
                        (human)
                        appears in the wikibase item data as the value of the 'instance of' property, the word
                        <strong>militaria</strong> usually does not appear there; the mechanism found items containing
                        words
                        with similar meanings and prepared the results on this basis.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Other example queries:</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 space-y-2">
                        <li>localities 16th century monarch ownership</li>
                        <li>mathematicians</li>
                        <li>architects</li>
                        <li>mill settlements</li>
                        <li>participants of the November Uprising</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It is worth comparing the results of the same queries with the full-text search mechanism in <a
                            href="https://wikihum.lab.dariah.pl/index.php?search" target="_blank"
                            class="text-amber-600 hover:text-amber-800 underline decoration-amber-200 decoration-2 underline-offset-2">WikiHum</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Using the example of the last query (participants of the November Uprising), one can notice how
                        semantic
                        search works (or fails). It is not precise filtering like in a database table; the mechanism
                        searches
                        for items that seem to have a meaning similar to the words in the query. In this case, we have a
                        word
                        related to an uprising (which probably influences the result the most), a word related to
                        participation,
                        and an adjective regarding the name of the uprising. In the results, we receive people
                        (correctly) who
                        participated in something (usually in uprisings); the first two results concern participants of
                        the
                        November Uprising, in the first 20 results there are 8 such persons, besides that we have
                        participants
                        of the January Uprising, Kościuszko Uprising. Semantic search results will therefore always be
                        slightly
                        'blurred'. For the first example (monarch ownership), 17 out of 20 results match the intent of
                        the
                        query, 2 results concern nobility localities and 1 the concept of 'monarch ownership' itself.
                        This
                        question is quite a precise filter and likely a SPARQL query would work better in such a
                        situation.<br />
                        In the case of WikiHum, the effects are also influenced by the small amount of text in the
                        knowledge
                        base.<br />
                        <br />
                        The returned results should also not be understood as 'matches' - the system returns all items
                        above a
                        certain relevance threshold, in order from most relevant to least relevant. It may happen that
                        the first
                        30 results are actually related to the query and the next ones are not, but all are displayed so
                        that
                        the user can decide on their usefulness.
                    </p>

                    <p>The search mechanism can mark words, or fragments of words, that are related to the query; the
                        full-text
                        component of the search engine is responsible for this, so words appearing directly in the query
                        content
                        are marked this way. After clicking on a specific result (the item label is a link), a details
                        window is
                        displayed where you can see fuller item data; there is also a link to the item in WikiHum.</p>

                    <p>The application displays the default first 20 results (sorted by relevance/similarity ranking);
                        at the
                        bottom of the screen, there is a button that can load the next part of the results (if they
                        exist).
